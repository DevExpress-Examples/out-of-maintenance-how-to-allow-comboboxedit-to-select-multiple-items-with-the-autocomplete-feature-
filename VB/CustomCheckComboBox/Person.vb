' How to allow ComboBoxEdit to select multiple items with the autocomplete feature
' 
' By default, ComboBoxEdit allows you to select one item using the autocomplete
' feature.
' This example provides a way to enable the behavior when the
' autocomplete feature works for multiple item selection. Firstly, it is necessary
' to create a ComboBoxEdit descendant and override the CreateEditStrategy method,
' which should return your own ComboBoxEditStrategy class descendant.
' Then,
' override and implement the ProcessChangeText method, and some more methods to
' enable item auto-searching selection.
' For unimpeded search and selection of
' items without losing input field focus, the set FocusPopupOnOpen property to
' False.
